# Working on Cubeship

Self-hosted PaaS for one VPS. Go, module `cubeship`, no external services
beyond Docker. `README.md` is the operator's intro; this file is for
whoever (or whatever) edits the code.

## Before you commit

```sh
make check
```

gofmt, `go vet` (including the build-tagged integration test, which a
plain `go vet ./...` never compiles), and the unit tests under `-race`.
`make help` lists the rest.

Commit messages: imperative subject saying what changes, body only when
the *why* isn't obvious. **Never credit an AI agent** — no
`Co-Authored-By: Claude`, no "generated with" footer, not in commits, PRs
or code comments.

Work happens on `master`, in the repository root. No worktrees.

## Layout

The code is organized by domain, not by technical layer. A module owns
everything about one concept — its entity, its persistence, its use
cases, and every surface it is reached through.

```
internal/
  user/         identities and the API keys they authenticate with
  org/          organizations, memberships, and all authorization
  project/      projects and the environments inside them
  app/          apps, deployments, and the deploy orchestrator
  registry/     who may docker push/pull, and the push webhook
  server/       mounts every module on the HTTP mux and the MCP endpoint
  platform/     infrastructure: database, dockerx, traefik, bootstrap,
                config, authkey, regauth, httpx
  envvar/ slug/ small shared vocabulary
cmd/cubeshipd/  the daemon
cmd/cubeship/   the CLI (cobra), one file per noun
internal/apiclient, internal/clicreds — what the CLI talks to the daemon with
```

Every domain module has the same shape:

| File | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `<name>.go` | the entity, its constants and its domain errors |
| `repository.go` | every SQL statement for its tables |
| `service.go` | the use cases — the only place business rules live |
| `http.go` | handlers, routes, and the domain-error → status mapping |
| `mcp.go` | the MCP tools |
| `openapi.go` | the OpenAPI operations for the routes in `http.go` |

**`http.go` and `mcp.go` are adapters and nothing else.** They parse
input, call one service method, and render the result. A rule that lives
in a handler is a rule the MCP surface doesn't have — that is exactly how
the two drifted apart before this layout.

Dependencies run one way: `user ← org ← project ← app`, with `registry`
and `server` on top. `server` is the only package that knows every module
exists.

## The OpenAPI document

Served at `/openapi.json`, with a Scalar reference at `/docs`. Both are
unauthenticated, because Scalar fetches the document from the browser
with no credentials to offer.

**The document is the product's API, not an inventory of routes.** It
describes what someone integrating against Cubeship would call:
organizations, projects, environments, apps. It leaves out the daemon's
own machinery (`/healthz`, `/openapi.json`, `/docs`, `/mcp`), the
registry's two endpoints (`docker` and the registry container call
those, nobody else), and API-key self-service, which you do once from the
CLI.

That exclusion is declared, never implied. `httpx.Router` has two
registration methods: `Handle` for a documented route, and
`HandleInternal` for one deliberately left out. A documented route with
no operation, an operation with no route, and an internal route that
*is* documented all fail a test — so the trimming cannot decay into
forgetting. `TestDocumentedSurfaceIsTheProductAPI` pins both lists, so
moving an endpoint between them is an edit someone made on purpose.

It is hand-written, module by module, in each `openapi.go` — not
generated from annotations. Every operation needs a unique
`operationId`, a summary, a tag, and its path parameters declared.

Error responses are `text/plain`, because that is what `http.Error`
writes. `openapi.Unauthorized`, `.Forbidden`, `.NotFound` and
`.BadRequest` carry the shared wording — including why 404 and 403 mean
different things.

## Database

Postgres through `pgx/v5/stdlib` over `database/sql`. Placeholders are
`$1`, `$2`, …, and there is **no `LastInsertId`** — an insert that needs
the new row returns it with `INSERT ... RETURNING <columns>`.

Schema changes are [goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose) migrations
in [`internal/platform/database/migrations`](internal/platform/database/migrations),
embedded into the binary. Add a numbered file with `-- +goose Up` and
`-- +goose Down`; never edit one that has shipped. Postgres has
transactional DDL, so each applies atomically, and they run on every
daemon start.

A `Repository` is a thin value over a `database.Queryer`, so the same code
runs on the pool or inside a transaction:

```go
db.WithTx(ctx, func(tx database.Queryer) error {
    users := user.NewRepository(tx)
    orgs  := org.NewRepository(tx)
    ...
})
```

Each table has a `columns` constant its scan function reads in order —
change one, change both. `env` columns are `JSONB`; go through
`envvar.MarshalJSONB` so a nil map becomes `{}` rather than JSON null.

The daemon runs its own `cubeship-postgres` container (see
`bootstrap.PostgresContainerOpts`) unless `CUBESHIP_DATABASE_URL` points
it at an existing server.

## Authorization

One question, one answer: `org.Service.Authorize`. Everything else
reaches it through `Resolve` on its own module's service.

The two refusals mean different things, and the difference is load-bearing:

- **404** — the caller is not a member of the organization at all, or the
  resource doesn't exist. Identical answers on purpose, so a valid API key
  can't enumerate tenants or app names by guessing.
- **403** — the caller IS a member but lacks the role. They already know
  the resource exists; hiding it would only confuse them.

`/mcp` is authenticated by the same bearer API key and **stateless on
purpose** — the server is rebuilt per request so its tools close over that
request's caller, and no session can be reused across users.

Slugs — orgs, projects, environments, apps — go through `slug.Valid`,
because they become path segments of a registry image reference and
Docker rejects anything else.

## Tests

Unit tests need a real Postgres; there is no in-memory mode. `make test`
starts one (`make db-up`, a container on port 5433) and
[`dbtest.New(t)`](internal/platform/database/dbtest) gives each test its
own schema inside it, dropped on cleanup — so tests stay isolated and can
run in parallel against one server.

A test with no database reachable **fails**, deliberately: skipping would
let `make check` report success for tests that never ran.

For anything above the repository,
[`servertest.New(t)`](internal/server/servertest) builds a fully wired
server and drives it through its real router. Use it from an external test
package (`package app_test`) — that is what keeps it from being an import
cycle.

The suite is deliberately not exhaustive. It covers the things that are
expensive to get wrong: the authorization matrix, deploy ordering and
rollback, transaction rollback, registry scope grants, and MCP parity with
HTTP. Docker is always faked. `test/integration` needs a Linux Docker
daemon (`--network host` doesn't reach the host on Docker Desktop) and
sits behind `//go:build integration`.
